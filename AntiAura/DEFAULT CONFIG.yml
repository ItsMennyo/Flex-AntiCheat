#Some useful information when configuring AntiAura:
#
#Don't forget to use /aconfig ingame! It can be faster than modifying the file.
#
#There are 20 ticks in 1 second.
#DON'T use decimals in values that are whole numbers! If the default value ends in a decimal, you can probably use decimals in it.
#
#Placeholders: %PLAYER% is the name of the hacker, %HACKNAME% is the name of the hack, %HACKAMOUNT% is the amount of times they have been caught for hacking previously.
#%CHECKNAME% is the check that detected the player for hacking (this can sometimes be the same as HACKNAME but can be different too).
#%NOTES% is the notes for each hack when detected. For example the CPS if caught for FastClick.
#
#Safe interaction means a player did something legitimately. Example: Actually taking damage from fire will lower the AntiFire threshold by the safe interaction.
#SafeHitDecrease, ArmSwingDecrease, LowerAmount, fetc, are basically all "how much you want the threshold to lower when a legitimate action occurs".
#They only have different names because "Safe HIT decrease" doesn't make sense for checks such as FastEat or Speed.
#
#The fastest way to get support is in the AntiAura Discord: https://discord.gg/3wCqvBh
#Please report minor bugs in discord that can be fixed quickly. Make sure to use the #bugs channel.
#If you want to report multiple significant bugs at a time, please PM me on Spigot.
