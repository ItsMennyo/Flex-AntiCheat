## Flex ➤ Minecraft AntiCheat

Welcome to my AntiCheat project called Flex. In this project, I optimize AntiCheats with better and advanced configs!

This, of course, helps to reduce false positives and bypasses. And what's beautiful is that it's completely free!

Currently there is an AAC and AntiAura version!

## Flex AntiCheat

Welcome to Flex AntiCheat project!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ItsMennyo/Flex-AntiCheat/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
